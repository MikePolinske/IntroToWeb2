        <h1>At the Window</h1>
        <h2>DH Laurence</h2>
        <p>
            The pine-trees bend to listen to the autumn wind as it mutters <br/>
            Something which sets the black poplars ashake with hysterical laughter <br/>
            While slowly the house of day is closing its eastern shutters.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further down the valley the clustered tombstones recede, <br/>
            Winding about their dimness the mist's grey cerements, after <br/>
            The street lamps in the darkness have suddenly started to bleed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The leaves fly over the window and utter a word as they pass <br/>
            To the face that leans from the darkness, intent, with two dark-filled eyes <br/>
            That watch for ever earnestly from behind the window glass.
        </p>
